Training Project Lab by Ahmed, Yassine, and Iheb ____ MovieKingdom
The Movie Database System is a dynamic web tool designed for viewing basic movie
information including casting, trailers, ratings, and so forth. It is intended to serve as a one-stop
shop where users can obtain upcoming, in-theater, DVD/Blu-ray, and digital movies.
In addition to showing the rankings from well-known websites like IMDB, our website enables
user evaluation of the films. It shows movie show timings for films being currently played in
theaters. It offers links to the DVD/Digital versions of the movies that are for purchase or even
watch them online. Additionally, it proposes related films that might be of interest to the user
and allows him to add a film to favorites or watchlist.
The Graphical User Interface (GUI) of our application will be designed in user friendly way. The
movies information is to be gathered through publicly accessible APIs offered by TMDb and
maybe other recognized API providers. The static information for each movie, such as the cast,
plot, poster, etc., is obtained from the APIs and entered to a local database. Calling the
appropriate APIs allows users to retrieve data that may change over time, such as ratings and
show times, in real time.
For that purpose, we plan to use React.js, Redux, and Material UI and maybe other tools that
might come in handy.
