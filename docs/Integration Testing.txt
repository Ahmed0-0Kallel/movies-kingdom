I am testing the movie library project using the React Testing Library to ensure the components behave as expected.

First, I have a test to check if clicking on a genre link updates the movie list component. This is done by rendering the NavBar and Movies components, finding a genre link, clicking on it, and then checking if the movie list updates with the correct number of movies.

Next, I have a test to ensure that searching for a movie name in the search bar returns movies with that name. This is done by rendering the NavBar and Movies components, simulating a user typing a movie name in the search bar, pressing Enter, and then checking if the movie list updates with the correct number of movies containing the searched term.

Lastly, I have a test to check if the MovieList component renders without crashing and renders the correct number of movies based on the numbersOfMoviesToShow prop.

These tests ensure that the movie library project behaves as expected, providing a reliable and robust user experience.
